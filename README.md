My name is Pidarareach Mom. I am an undergraduated student at California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB). I am going to graduate in Fall 2025. I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I learned a lot of programming languages, such as C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, and other programming languages.

I first coded back when I was in Community College Moreno Valley. That is when I was exposed to programming. My first programming language is C++, which I have the most experience with. After that, I participated in the Data Science Fellowship at University of Riverside in summer 2023, where I learned Python and did a project from it. Later on, I took other classes at CSUSB to learn other languages.

After getting my Bachelor's Degree, I hope to be a Data Scientist because I enjoyed and learned so much from the fellowship. Also, I will go on to earn myself a Master's Degree in Computer Science as well.
